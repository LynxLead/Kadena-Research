I am not an expert on crypto, but I understand algorithms and distributed systems. It seems that scaling is one major challenge that blockchains have to overcome in order for crypto to grow. There are several players which are working with different approaches on a solution. At this point nobody can say with certainty which approaches are going to win in the end. But I think Chainweb has a fair chance. I think, it's a very elegant and robust solution, actually, the best that I've seen so far. I have little production level experience with smart contracts, but I trust Will and Stuarts professional experience in this field to make the right design decisions. Generally, the arguments in favor of Pact over Solidity make a lot of sense to me. But this is all for the long game and we won't be able to play it if we run out of money in between. That's were marketing, the KDA token, and the community come in. I think, in the end technology matters and as long as we stay can in the game we have chance to be successful.

Developing new technology, in particular scalable solutions, does not come for free. Innovation takes effort and time.

Unfortunately, as long a lot of the crypto market is dominated by hype, it's too easy to go after short term gains by just creating an ERC-20 or copy-and-pasting some exiting code. Projects that provide solutions to existing problems and deliver technology, features, and performance have a hard time currently.

On the mid-to-long term, if the promise of bockchains is true and blockchainn technology has some utility, aspects like performance, security, and a powerful smart contract language, will make the difference in the success of a project.

There is no way that any non-trivial application can operate economically on Ethereum at current gas prizes and scale. Sooner or later economic considerations will force applications to move to more efficient systems.

The important thing is: Kadena has delivered technology that solves the biggest problem of current block chain technology: Scale. Mainnet is up and running since over a year. It's cheap to use, it's fast, it scales, it's decentralized, and ready for adoption. And don't think that layer-2 solutions and base-layer technology are competing. Both target different kinds of of applications and some applications will deploy both layers.

Any layer-2 solution needs a base layer and it's just economic reasoning to pick the most efficient solution.

Personally, I think there's an actual risk that PoS systems are going to be successful precisely because they are convenient for those who are already in control of the financial system. (It may even make it more centralized by neglecting the stake of users of money and overstating the stake of owners of money. The use of money for economic transactions looses importance and the aspect of establishing power through wealth gains.) I think PoW, and in particular Nakamoto consensus, has the potential innovate over the status quo by providing a new mechanism for establishing decentralized control on a global scale.
