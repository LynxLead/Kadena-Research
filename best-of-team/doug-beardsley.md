> 1. what's the reason anyone would build on it?

Because we actually delivered scalability. I'm not aware of any other project that has. It seems like there's lots of competition in this space, but none of them have actually delivered. And Proof of Stake just isn't very decentralized. It's really feudalistic rule by the wealthy few who were initial stakeholders.

> 1. Is the intention to be an enterprise product? Or an alternative chain that takes congestion off ETH?

If scaling mainnet from 10 to 20 chains isn't sexy to you, then I don't know what is...

We’re still working out the precise details of how the bridge tokens will work. We’ve discovered a surprising amount of complexity as we have been digging into the technical details. Oddly enough, I’m kind of happy about that. It means that projects that don’t have the incredible engineering chops that Kadena has will likely have a tough time competing once we work through the details. We have actually done quite a bit in the enterprise space. After all, Kadena was originally a private blockchain company focused on the enterprise market. See for example our collaboration with USCF, a multi-billion dollar company with lots of traditional finance experience. We are still very keen to do more in the enterprise space but it seems like enterprises still don’t have a great understanding of what kinds of applications can really benefit from blockchains. This doesn’t surprise me at all because it took me quite some time to develop the picture that I currently have in my head about the space. And even now I think I’ll be developing increasing clarity for quite some time.

> There is no greed here. Did you look at the link I posted? Kadena has one of the lowest percentages of coins going to insiders out there. Other prominent projects are in the range of 50-70%!!! The vast majority of our coins are locked up. No matter what kind of schedule you come up with, the inflation rates will be higher at the beginning. Nobody has presented a concrete schedule saying exactly how many coins should be released when that we can debate.  [- Source](https://t.me/kadena\_io/48823)
