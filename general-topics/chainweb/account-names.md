# Account Names

You know how ETH and BTC have projects for "naming" accounts (e.g. [https://ens.domains/](https://ens.domains) )? They need this because, at their most basic level and to oversimplify slightly, coins and contracts are "owned" by public keys. So to make it human-readable, they need some service for associating a "name" with a key/hash. KDA will never need a name service because our most basic unit are "names" that associated with keys/contracts. Given that this is a bit of a learning curve, our standard wallet UX for account creation _mimics_ ETH/BTC's approach, in that the "name" is made the same as the "key". As time goes on, and people get more used to the concept, it'll be more likely that people will have an account with a regular name like `leanmachine` and rotate the associated keys from time to time. This lets you have a stable name on mainnet for transactions.
